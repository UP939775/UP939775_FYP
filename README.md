# Final Year Project

**DISCLAIMER** This project has been created for academic use only 

Within inner cities and other highly populated areas it is not uncommon for outdoor exercise facilities to be occupied for long periods of time. At present there is no way of confirming what facilities are in use without physically being there. The time and effort required to visit such locations to check if they are available to use can often discourage people from using them at all.

This project will follow the conception, implementation and evaluation of Project Park, an easy to use web application that can be utilised by members of the public to view timely information on activity in parks and communal outdoor spaces relative to their location. The project aims to provide a suitable solution to the difficulties encountered when looking for appropriate spaces for physical activity in highly populated areas.

The scope of this project extends only to the development of the web application and will not contain work on the creation of a hardware component that would be needed for the application to be deployed. This project will make use of a black box testing strategy that will have a separate component to simulate the data that would be captured by a hardware component in a complete version of the application.


To use this application, clone the repository and run npm install from inside.

NPM start can be used to start the application.

When running the applicaiton can be run by going to http://localhost:8080/

To make use of the simulated hardware component go to http://localhost:8080/hardware-simulation/index.html
